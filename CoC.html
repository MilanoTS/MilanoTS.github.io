        <p>
          All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our meetup are
          required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will
          enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all
          participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.
        </p>

        <h2>The Quick Version</h2>

        <p>
          Our group is dedicated to providing a harassment-free meetup
          experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and
          expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
          body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology
          choices. We do not tolerate harassment of meetup participants in
          any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any
          meetup venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and
          other online media. Meetup participants violating these rules may
          be sanctioned or expelled from the meetup
          <em>without a refund</em> at the discretion of the meetup
          organisers.
        </p>

        <h2>The Less Quick Version</h2>

        <p>
          Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender,
          gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability,
          physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology
          choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation,
          stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained
          disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact,
          and unwelcome sexual attention.
        </p>

        <p>
          Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
          comply immediately.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In
          particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or
          other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use
          sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a
          sexualised environment.
        </p>

        <p>
          If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the meetup
          organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including
          warning the offender or expulsion from the meetup with no refund.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed,
          or have any other concerns, please contact a member of meetup
          staff immediately.
        </p>

        <p>
          Meetup staff will be happy to help participants contact
          hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or
          otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the
          duration of the meetup. We value your attendance.
        </p>

        <p>
          We expect participants to follow these rules at meetup and
          workshop venues and related social events.
        </p>
